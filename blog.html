          Differences between var, let, and const:
        </h1>
        <p class="text-xl font-medium mb-4">
          In JavaScript, users can declare a variable using 3 keywords that are
          var, let, and const. In this article, we will see the differences
          between the var, let, and const keywords. We will discuss the scope
          and other required concepts about each keyword.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-12 mb-5">
          <span class="text-3xl font-bold title">JavaScript var keyword:</span>
          The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5">
          <span class="text-2xl font-medium">Scope:</span> Global scoped or
          function scoped. The scope of the var keyword is the global or
          function scope. It means variables defined outside the function can be
          accessed globally, and variables defined inside a particular function
          can be accessed within the function.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Example 1:</span> Variable ‘a’ is declared globally. So, the
          scope of the variable ‘a’ is global, and it can be accessible
          everywhere in the program. The output shown is in the console.
        </p>
        <p>
          function f() { <br />
          console.log(a) } <br />
          f(); <br />
          console.log(a); var a = 10 <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Output:</span> <br />
          10 <br />
          10
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Example 2:</span> The variable ‘a’ is declared inside the
          function. If the user tries to access it outside the function, it will
          display the error. Users can declare the 2 variables with the same
          name using the var keyword. Also, the user can reassign the value into
          the var variable. The output is shown in the console.
        </p>
        <p>
          function f() { <br />
          // It can be accessible any <br />
          // where within this function <br />
          var a = 10;<br />
          console.log(a)<br />
          }<br />
          f();<br />
          // A cannot be accessible <br />
          // outside of function<br />
          console.log(a);
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Output:</span> <br />
          10 <br />
          ReferenceError: a is not defined
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Example 3:</span> The user can re-declare the variable using var
          and the user can update the var variable. The output is shown in the
          console.
          <br />

          var a = 10 <br />
          // User can re-declare <br />
          // variable using var var <br />
          a = 8 <br />
          // User can update var variable <br />
          a = 7 <br />
          <span>Output:</span> 7
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Example 4:</span> If users use the var variable before the
          declaration, it initializes with the undefined value. The output is
          shown in the console.
        </p>
        <p>
          console.log(a); <br />
          var a = 10;
        </p>
        <p><span>Output:</span> undefined</p>
        <p class="mt-12 mb-5">
          <span class="text-3xl font-bold title">JavaScript let keyword:</span>
          The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Scope:</span>
          block scoped: The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It
          can’t be accessible outside the particular block ({block}). Let’s see
          the below example.
        </p>
        <p><span>Example 1:</span> The output is shown in the console.</p>
        <p>
          let a = 10; <br />
          function f() { <br />
          let b = 9 <br />
          console.log(b);<br />
          console.log(a); <br />
          } <br />
          f();<br />
          Output: 9 10
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Example 2:</span> The code returns an error because we are
          accessing the let variable outside the function block. The output is
          shown in the console.
        </p>
        <p>
          let a = 10; <br />
          function f() { <br />
          if (true) { <br />
          let b = 9 <br />
          // It prints 9 <br />
          console.log(b); } <br />// It gives error as it <br />
          // defined in if block<br />
          console.log(b); } <br />
          f() <br />
          // It prints 10 <br />
          console.log(a) <br />
          Output: 9 <br />
          ReferenceError: b is not defined
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Example 3:</span> Users cannot re-declare the variable defined
          with the let keyword but can update it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Example 4:</span> Users can declare the variable with the same
          name in different blocks using the let keyword.
        </p>
        <p>
          let a = 10 <br />
          // It is not allowed let a = 10<br />
          // It is allowed a = 10 <br />
          Output: Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
        </p>
        <p>
          let a = 10 <br />
          if (true) { <br />
          let a = 9 console.log(a) <br />

          // It prints 10 <br />
          Output: 9 10
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Example 5:</span> If users use the let variable before the
          declaration, it does not initialize with undefined just like a var
          variable, and returns an error. <br />
          console.log(a);<br />
          let a = 10;<br />
          Output: Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before

            >const keyword in JavaScript:</span
          >
          The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let
          keyword, except the user cannot update it. <br />
          <span>Scope:</span> block scoped: When users declare a const variable,
          they need to initialize it, otherwise, it returns an error. The user
          cannot update the const variable once it is declared. <br />
          <span>Example 1:</span>: We are changing the value of the const

          <h1 class="text-2xl md:text-5xl mb-5">What is a REST API?</h1>
          <p class="mb-4">
            An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that
            define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate
            with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design
            principles of the REST, or representational state transfer
            architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes
            referred to RESTful APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            First defined in 2000 by computer scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in his
            doctoral dissertation, REST provides a relatively high level of
            flexibility and freedom for developers. This flexibility is just one
            reason why REST APIs have emerged as a common method for connecting
            components and applications in a microservices architecture.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-12">
          <h1 class="text-2xl md:text-5xl mb-5">REST design principles:</h1>
          <p>
            At the most basic level, an API is a mechanism that enables an
            application or service to access a resource within another
            application or service. The application or service doing the
            accessing is called the client, and the application or service
            containing the resource is called the server.
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>
              Some APIs, such as SOAP or XML-RPC, impose a strict framework on
              developers. But REST APIs can be developed using virtually any
              programming language and support a variety of data formats. The
              only requirement is that they align to the following six REST
              design principles - also known as architectural constraints:
            </p>
            <ul class="mt-4">
              <li>
                <span class="text-xl ml-2 mb-2">1.Uniform interface:</span>All
                API requests for the same resource should look the same, no
                matter where the request comes from. The REST API should ensure
                that the same piece of data, such as the name or email address
                of a user, belongs to only one uniform resource identifier
                (URI). Resources shouldn’t be too large but should contain every
                piece of information that the client might need.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="text-xl ml-2 mb-2"
                  >2. Client-server decoupling:</span
                >
                In REST API design, client and server applications must be
                completely independent of each other. The only information the
                client application should know is the URI of the requested
                resource; it can't interact with the server application in any
                other ways. Similarly, a server application shouldn't modify the
                client application other than passing it to the requested data
                via HTTP.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="text-xl ml-2 mb-2">3. Statelessness:</span> REST
                APIs are stateless, meaning that each request needs to include
                all the information necessary for processing it. In other words,
                REST APIs do not require any server-side sessions. Server
                applications aren’t allowed to store any data related to a
                client request.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="text-xl ml-2 mb-2">4. Cacheability:</span> When
                possible, resources should be cacheable on the client or server
                side. Server responses also need to contain information about
                whether caching is allowed for the delivered resource. The goal
                is to improve performance on the client side, while increasing
                scalability on the server side.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="text-xl ml-2 mb-2"
                  >5. Layered system architecture:</span
                >
                In REST APIs, the calls and responses go through different
                layers. As a rule of thumb, don’t assume that the client and
                server applications connect directly to each other. There may be
                a number of different intermediaries in the communication loop.
                REST APIs need to be designed so that neither the client nor the
                server can tell whether it communicates with the end application
                or an intermediary.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="text-xl ml-2 mb-2"
                  >6. Code on demand (optional):</span
                >
                REST APIs usually send static resources, but in certain cases,
                responses can also contain executable code (such as Java
                applets). In these cases, the code should only run on-demand.

          <p>
            REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database
            functions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records
            (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a REST API
            would use a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to
            create one, a PUT request to update a record, and a DELETE request
            to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used in API calls. A
            well-designed REST API is similar to a website running in a web
            browser with built-in HTTP functionality.
          </p>
          <p class="my-5">
            The state of a resource at any particular instant, or timestamp, is
            known as the resource representation. This information can be
            delivered to a client in virtually any format including JavaScript
            Object Notation (JSON), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON
            is popular because it’s readable by both humans and machines—and it
            is programming language-agnostic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Request headers and parameters are also important in REST API calls
            because they include important identifier information such as
            metadata, authorizations, uniform resource identifiers (URIs),
            caching, cookies and more. Request headers and response headers,
            along with conventional HTTP status codes, are used within
            well-designed REST APIs.

        <div class="mt-12">
          <h1 class="text-2xl md:text-5xl mb-5">REST API best practices</h1>
          <p>
            Although flexibility is a big advantage of REST API design, that
            same flexibility makes it easy to design an API that’s broken or
            performs poorly. For this reason, professional developers share best
            practices in REST API specifications.
          </p>
          <p class="my-5">
            The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) establishes an interface for
            describing an API in a way that allows any developer or application
            to discover it and fully understand its parameters and capabilities
            - available endpoints, allowed operations on each endpoint,
            operation parameters, authentication methods, and other information.
            The latest version, OAS3 (link resides outside ibm.com), includes
            with hands-on tools, such as the OpenAPI Generator, for generating
            API clients and server stubs in different programming languages
          </p>
          <p>
            Securing a REST API also starts with industry best practices, such
            as using hashing algorithms for password security and HTTPS for
            secure data transmission. An authorization framework like OAuth 2.0
            (link resides outside ibm.com) can help limit the privileges of
            third-party applications. Using a timestamp in the HTTP header, an
            API can also reject any request that arrives after a certain time
            period. Parameter validation and JSON Web Tokens are other ways to
            ensure that only authorized clients can access the API.

          <p>
            Null in JavaScript means an empty value and is also a primitive type
            in JavaScript. The variable which has been assigned as null contains
            no value. Undefined, on the other hand, means the variable has been
            declared, but its value has not been assigned.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-10">
          <h3 class="text-3xl">What is Null?</h3>
          <p>
            We have heard the word "null" many times in English. Its literal
            meaning is having no value. The same meaning is analogous to the
            meaning of null in programming. Null is basically an assignment
            value given to a variable. The variable which has been assigned as
            null contains no value. When we assign null as a value to any
            variable, it means that it is empty or blank. It is to show that the
            variable has no value. Also, null is an object in JavaScript. When
            it gets assigned to a variable, it represents no value. The setting
            of the value must be done manually by the user as JavaScript never
            sets the value as null. An object can be emptied by setting it to
            null. <br />

        <div class="mt-10">
          <h3 class="text-3xl">What is Undefined?</h3>
          <ps>
            There is a subtle difference between null and undefined, but as a
            programmer, it is important that we understand it clearly. As the
            name suggests, undefined means "not defined". So we declare a
            variable but do not assign a value to it, the variable becomes
            undefined. Unlike null, the value of an undefined variable is set by
            JavaScript as undefined. The variable gets created at the run-time.
            When we do not pass an argument for a function parameter, the
            default value is taken as undefined. Besides, when a function
            doesn't return a value, it returns undefined. <br />

        <div class="mt-10">
          <h3 class="text-3xl">Type of Null and Undefined</h3>
          <p>
            In JavaScript, to check the type of variable, we use the "typeof"
            operator.
          </p>
          <p class="my-5">
            Example- <br />
            var x=null; <br />
            console.log(typeof(x));<br />
            Output- object <br />
            Here we have assigned the null value to variable x and then checked
            its type. Undefined- <br />
            console.log(typeof undefined); <br />
            Output- undefined <br />
            As discussed above, the type of undefined is undefined itself. So
            basically, it is a data type.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example- <br />
            var x; <br />
            console.log(typeof(x)); <br />
            Output- undefined <br />
            Here we have declared variable x and then checked its type. During
            run time, undefined gets assigned to the variable x.
          </p>

        <div class="mt-10">
          <h3 class="text-3xl">Why is Null an Object?</h3>
          <p>
            Basically, null is a primitive type of a variable in JavaScript.
            Many people consider it a bug in JavaScript as it considers null as
            an object. Changing or fixing this bug will break the existing
            codebase, so it is not yet changed. The type of null is an object.
            That is why it is treated as an object. There is another theory
            behind this. The initial version of JavaScript had values stored as
            32 bits. The first 3 bits represented the data type, and the
            remaining bits represented the value. So for all the objects, the
            type started from 000. <br />
            Null typically means empty, so it had all 0s stored in 32 bits. So
            the JavaScript reads the first 3 digits of null, which are all 0 and
            hence treats it as an object. The figure represents the same concept
            used in the initial version of JavaScript. Why is null an object In
            APIs, null is often used or returned in a place where an object can
            be expected as the output but no object is relevant. This shows the
            absence of an object as null is returned.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-10">
          <h3 class="text-3xl">Differentiating Using isNaN()</h3>
          The difference between null and undefined in JavaScript can also be
          made while performing arithmetic operations like- addition,
          subtraction, multiplication, division etc. While performing various
          arithmetic operations, null is converted to 0, and then the operation
          is performed, while undefined is converted to NaN. This is so because
          while performing arithmetic operations, the function toNumber() gets
          called on it, which converts null to 0 and undefined to NaN. <br />
          var length=19; <br />
          var breadth; <br />
          var area=length*breadth; <br />
          console.log(area); <br />
          //NaN <br />
          var length2=19; <br />
          var breadth2=null; <br />
          var area2=length2*breadth2; <br />
          console.log(area2); //0 <br />
          Output- <br />
          NaN <br />
          0 <br />
          We can see that when we perform arithmetic operations on null, the
          value gets converted to 0 and then the further operations get
          performed. When we perform arithmetic operations on undefined, it
          prints NaN as the value is undefined and not a number. Use this Online

              Output- 1 <br />
              As we know, when we initialize a variable as null, and perform
              arithmetic operations on it, then it gets converted to 0. We have
              calculated the exponent of the base, and here the exponent is 0 so

              Output- <br />
              NaN <br />
              undefined <br />
              As discussed above, we haven't passed any argument for 'h' so it
              takes the default value as undefined. And we have performed
              arithmetic operations on variables out of which one is undefined,
              so the result is NaN. JavaScript is the language that powers the
